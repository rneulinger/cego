== Issues in RBT

* Node Dialog doesn't close when pressing kbd:[ESC]
* RBT adds UI-Type not in RBT.cfg
* RBT asks for saving after starting without having changed the model +
  I'm not shure if this also happens when load last model on startup is activated.
* Dialog Edit Node appears partly outside of screen if using 3 monitors
* multiple links from note to a tag are possible


== Requirements for cegr (Cause Effect Graph)

* strong builder rules
* easy to use
* easy to compose
* ability to define components
